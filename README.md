component-identification
========================
- Welcome to the probabilistic component identification tool!

- This tool is used to identify software components from a given feature set representing a software system
- The tool extends some of Apache Mahout's implementation of unsupervisd learning algorithms
- It also reports the quality of the identified components in terms standard evaluation measures
- More stuff coming up soon!
