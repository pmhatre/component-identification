component-identification
========================
- Welcome to the probabilistic component identification tool!

- The tool is used to identify software components for given feature set representing a software system
- One part of the tool extends some of Apache Mahout's implementation of unsupervisd learning algorithm
- The second part performs entropy computations on the identified components
- More stuff coming up soon!
